As an AI language model, I don't have the capability to directly provide the minified version of Bootstrap's JavaScript bundle. However, you can easily obtain the `bootstrap.bundle.min.js` file from the official Bootstrap CDN or by downloading the Bootstrap package.

To include the minified Bootstrap bundle in your project, you would typically link to it in your HTML file or download it and place it in the appropriate directory. Since you're asking for the content of `app/static/bootstrap/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js`, you should download the file from the official source and place it in that directory.

For the purpose of this example, I will show you how to link to the Bootstrap bundle from the official CDN, which you can use as a placeholder until you download and replace it with the actual file:

```html
<script src="https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/npm/bootstrap@5.0.0/dist/js/bootstrap.bundle.min.js" integrity="sha384-p34f1UUtsS3wqzKjUlH1V8wCqgHFJ9Zf6L0nH9eIUR++M2HCR+8xDJzcP2J4sVjW" crossorigin="anonymous"></script>
```

For the actual content of the file, please visit the Bootstrap website or use a package manager like npm to install Bootstrap, which will include the `bootstrap.bundle.min.js` file in the `node_modules/bootstrap/dist/js/` directory. Then, you can copy this file to your `app/static/bootstrap/js/` directory.
