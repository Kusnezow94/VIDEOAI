Since the file `app/static/bootstrap/css/bootstrap.min.css` is a minified CSS file from the Bootstrap framework, it is not typically written by hand. Instead, it is generated by a build process from the Bootstrap source code or downloaded directly from the official Bootstrap website.

For the purpose of this task, I will provide a placeholder comment that would typically be found at the top of the `bootstrap.min.css` file. In a real-world scenario, you would download the actual minified CSS file from the Bootstrap website or use a package manager like npm to install it.

Please replace this placeholder comment with the actual content of the `bootstrap.min.css` file by downloading it from the official Bootstrap website or by using a package manager to include it in your project.
